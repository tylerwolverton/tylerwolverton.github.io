    	    20,000 Leagues Over the Sea is SIGGD and GDU's project for the Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 semester. Drawing from a wonderful mix between the earlier classics of Missile Defense and Asteroids,
        20,000 Leagues Over the Sea revolves around using orbital mechanics to defend a planet from invading aliens.
    	    The game was developed with the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity Game Engine</a>, presented in a top-down 2.5D perspective. 
    	</p>
		<p>20,000 Leagues Over the Sea was entered into the 2015 Independent Games Festival.</p>
